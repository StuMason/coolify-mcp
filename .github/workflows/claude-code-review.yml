            This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for the Coolify API. Focus on:

            **Critical Issues:**
            - Security vulnerabilities (exposed tokens, injection attacks, unsafe data handling)
            - Breaking changes to the MCP tool interface
            - Bugs that would cause runtime errors

            **Code Quality:**
            - TypeScript type safety - ensure proper typing, avoid `any`
            - Error handling - all API calls should have proper error handling
            - Consistency with existing patterns in coolify-client.ts and mcp-server.ts

            **Testing:**
            - New functionality should have corresponding tests
            - Tests should cover edge cases and error conditions

            Keep feedback concise and actionable. Skip minor style issues that Prettier/ESLint will catch.

            Use `gh pr comment` to post your review. If no critical issues, say "✅ LGTM - No critical issues found."
